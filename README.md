# Inv_cooccurrence_Mguttatus
This repository contains the code and data analysis scripts for the study on chromosomal inversion co-occurrence patterns in 
Mimulus guttatus. The study compares analytical techniques to investigate patterns of attraction and repulsion among inversion 
orientations.

In order to replicate the analysis, the only thing you need to do is defining the work directory in the main script, or running
such script from the command line by typing `Rscript ./main.r` from the cloned directory.
